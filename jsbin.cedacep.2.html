  <h1>Hello There</h1>
  <p> Thanks for visiting my page.</p>
  <p> So for this second post I'm gonna be giving
    you some insight on my favorite food - because 
    I love food and because it part of my pirple
    homework.<p/>
  <p> My favorite food in the whole world is
    chocolate mud cake. he very first time i tasted
  a mud cake was...maybe...a year ago in confectionary 
    store called <strong>The Bread Cafe</strong>. 
  I am not quite sure how my mother and i ended up in that store
  but it definitly ranks amongest the best decisions
    we have made ever. One cannot help but be in high
  spirits when eating this cake. Its sweetness will
  make your blood boil with a sense of euphoria 
    (and no, its not a sugar rush). The reason I love this cake is 
  simple. It makes me <em>happy</em>. And that's it.</p>
  <p> So here's how you make a chocolate mud cake.</p>
